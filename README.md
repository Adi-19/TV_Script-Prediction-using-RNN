# TV_Script-Prediction-using-RNN

# Overview
Generating fake TV scripts using RNNs based on patterns it recognizes in the training data.

# RNN
RNNs are called recurrent because they perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being depended on the previous computations and you already know that they have a “memory” which captures information about what has been calculated so far.
